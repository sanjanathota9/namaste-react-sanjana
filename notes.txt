The crossorigin attribute is like a passport for resources on a webpage. It controls how the browser requests resources from other domains (websites).
<script>, and <video> to specify how to handle the request.
There are two main ways the crossorigin attribute works:

Anonymous: This tells the browser to not send any cookies or user credentials with the request. It's like getting a visitor's pass to the other country.
Use-credentials: This allows the browser to send cookies and credentials if the server allows it. It's like getting a visa for the other country.
In summary: The crossorigin attribute helps you control how your webpage interacts with resources from other domains, ensuring both security and functionality.


It's a network of servers spread around the world that stores copies of a website's content (like images and videos). When someone visits the website, their computer downloads the content from the server closest to them, making the website load faster. 
CDN links are specific addresses that point to files hosted on a content delivery network (CDN).  These links can be used to include things like JavaScript libraries, images, or stylesheets on a website.
